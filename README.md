## Project: Password Strength Checker

## Project Overview

The **Password Strength Checker** is a web-based tool designed to assess the strength of passwords in real time. Password security is critical in today's digital landscape, where weak passwords are often a leading cause of security breaches. This tool helps users ensure that the passwords they create are strong and meet various security standards.

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- **Enhance Password Security** by providing users with instant feedback on the strength of their passwords.
- **Improve User Awareness** of strong password practices, thus encouraging the creation of secure and complex passwords.
- **Promote Cyber Hygiene** by evaluating password complexity, uniqueness, and length, crucial factors in reducing vulnerability to cyber-attacks.

### Key Activities

During the project, the following tasks were carried out:
- Developed a **real-time password strength checker** that provides feedback based on password length, complexity, and uniqueness.
- Implemented checks for the presence of **lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters**.
- Integrated **visual feedback** to notify users if their passwords are weak, moderate, or strong.
- Styled the interface for a clean and user-friendly experience.
  
### Features

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback as they type their password.
- **Password Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Length (minimum of 8 characters)
  - Use of lowercase letters
  - Use of uppercase letters
  - Inclusion of numeric digits
  - Use of special characters (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.)
  - Uniqueness of characters (reduction of repetition)
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: The strength of the password is color-coded:
  - Red for Weak
  - Orange for Moderate
  - Green for Strong

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Scripting**: JavaScript
- **Development Environment**: Chrome Browser for testing and deployment

### Key Insights

During the development of the Password Strength Checker, the following insights were gained:
- **User-Friendly Security**: Complex password guidelines are often overlooked by users. Providing instant feedback encourages adherence to strong password practices.
- **Balancing Complexity & Usability**: While strong passwords are necessary, they must be easy enough for users to remember while maintaining security.
- **Cybersecurity Education**: Many users are unaware of how easily compromised weak passwords are. This tool bridges that gap by educating users on how to create secure passwords.

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehulMahaveerNahar/password-strength-checker.git
   ```

2. **Run the Project**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (preferably Chrome) by simply double-clicking the file or opening it through your browser.

3. **Test the Tool**:
   - Enter a password in the input field.
   - Receive real-time feedback on password strength and suggestions for improvement.

### Future Improvements

- **Password Suggestions**: Generate strong password suggestions for users.
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages to make the tool accessible globally.
- **Backend Integration**: Save user password strength analytics in a database for further insights and reports.
